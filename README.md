# blogeek-app


This repo contains the Blogeek frontEnd repo, and the Blogeek BackEnd repo.

this is MANDATORY to get all the submodule inside this repository in order to make the application work.
all you have to do is to clone this repo, to type these two commands :

`git submodule init`

`git submodule update --recursive --remote`

you have to do the same thing in the frontEnd repo and the BackEnd repo, in order to get the libraries mandatory to get types and functionnal other things.

You can also read the documentation in the two repositories to make al the application work.

Have fun !
